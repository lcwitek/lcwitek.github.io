title: Statistics vs Data Scientists

#### The four articles I read in preperation for this blog post are listed below:

[Data Scientists vs Statisticians](https://medium.com/odscjournal/data-scientists-versus-statisticians-8ea146b7a47f)

[Machine Learning Engineer vs Data Scientist](https://www.springboard.com/blog/machine-learning-engineer-vs-data-scientist/)

[Data Science vs Data Analytics vs Machine Learning: Expert Talk](https://www.simplilearn.com/data-science-vs-data-analytics-vs-machine-learning-article)

[This is the difference between statistics and data science](https://mixpanel.com/blog/2016/03/30/this-is-the-difference-between-statistics-and-data-science/)

#### What do you think being a data scientist is about?
I think being a data scientist is about combining multiple areas of study and knowledge into one job/position. All the articles seem to agree that these areas are computer science, mathematics, statistics, and specific domain knowledge. I think it is also about being the “behind the scenes” person. You are developing all the background of a project before it gets but integrated into the platform. 


#### What do you see as the major duties and/or knowledge areas? 
Major duties would include research and develop statistical models, comb through data to better understand the needs and wants of the consumer/company, collaboration with others such as engineers, develop and optimize data models/algorithms, and use predictive modeling to help the consumer/company. 

I see the most important knowledge areas as, previously mentioned, computers science, mathematics, and statistics. Although I do not think you need to be an expert in any one field of study. Ready through these articles it seems as though you should be experienced in at least one field and then have a solid understanding of the others. 

####  What differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians?  
The similarities that I see are that they both have to have an understanding of main statistical concepts like model selection and data analysis. The differences seem to stem from the coding languages that data scientists are to have experience with. Although statisticians do have experience with coding it, to me, seems to typically be based in programs that are used specifically for statistical analysis, such as SAS, and not computer coding such as C++ or Java.

In my opinion, there is a lot of overlap between data scientists and statisticians. I think it would be an easy transition for a statistician to be labeled a data scientist with learning the computer programing side of a data scientists’ job. 

#### How do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?
I would say that I am a statistician with small dabblings in being a data scientist. However, after reading the article Machine Learning Engineer vs Data Scientist and reading different postings for the role of data scientist, I would say that I am not sure that I am interested in going towards the data scientist route, at least not in the roles they have outlined. I would prefer to go into the health care side of things instead of the business side of things. I know that healthcare is technically a business, but I would like to do the work of a biostatistician or analyst. Some areas of data scientists do interest me though and are worth looking into.
