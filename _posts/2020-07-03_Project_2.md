## Outline of Project 2
The dataset being used for this anaylsis can be found at [Online News Popularity Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+News+Popularity).

This data set has information from articles that were published by [Mashable](www.mashable.com). It does not contain the original content but some statistics associated with it. 

The purpose of this analysis is to find the best model for predicting values for the `shares` variable. The three models I will be using are k Nearest Neighbors, Classification Tree, and Random Forest.

## Reflections

### What would you do differently?

I would do smaller parts of the project at a time. I kept getting frustrated when trying to work on bigger chunks at a time. I think it might have actually taken me longer and more days to do the project then if I would have split it up into sections. 

### What was the most difficult part for you?

Hands down trying to get rmarkdown to knit into 7 documents. It took a very long time for me to figure out that I needed to have the code it it's own .md. I also wasn't sure exactly what was needed in the YAML header and finding examples of how to do this specifically like we were supposed to was not easy. 

### What are your big take-aways from this project?

That I still have a lot to learn.
