The dataset being used for this anaylsis can be found at [Online News Popularity Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+News+Popularity).

This data set has information from articles that were published by [Mashable](www.mashable.com). It does not contain the original content but some statistics associated with it. 

The purpose of this analysis is to find the best model for predicting values for the `shares` variable. The three models I will be using are k Nearest Neighbors, Classification Tree, and Random Forest.
