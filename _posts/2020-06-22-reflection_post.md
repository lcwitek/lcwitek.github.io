### How is the course going so far?  
I think the course is going pretty well so far. I am enjoying learning R and I find it really cool to ouput to github and html. 


### What do you like about the course and what would you change about the course?
I like the flow of the course. I feel that everything we go over in class is helpful for the homeworks. The only thing I would change about the course so far is that sometimes a function is referenced but the package it belongs in is not listed. This doesn't happen often and usually is with something that is part of an aside. 

### Any other thoughts? 
The first few lectures there were questions imbeded in the lectures to make sure we were understanding the material. I wish more of those questions were incorporated throughout the lectures. These are great practice questions for the exam and also make it clear when something isn't being understood.
