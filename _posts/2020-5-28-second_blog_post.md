title: R Programming vs Other Statistical Software
---

#### What are your thoughts on R vs whatever other software you've used?

  I think that R is a fairly straightforward software to use if you have had other programming experience. The syntax is not the same as other software programs but it is still pretty easy to follow. Currently, we have been learning functions in R and to me, they are similar to creating Macros within SAS. SAS is the other main software that I have used. I was biased towards SAS (as in I liked it a lot more than R) but now that I am learning the fundamentals I am enjoying R as well. 

#### What functionality do you like about R?

  My favorite functionality of R is RMarkdown. It is the best tool to put all of the work together without having to copy and paste code, output, and thoughts onto another document. It saves time but also allows you to easily go through the pieces of code if you are looking for a specific section of code. I used this functionality in a previous class thanks to a classmate who suggested that we use it. It was an easy way for our group to combine all our work and check the work done by others. 

#### What parts do you miss about your other language?
  
  I miss the familiarity of SAS but R has now become more familiar to me. Since I currently am only using SAS and R during classes and not out in the real world it makes it easier to not truly miss anything.  

#### Do you consider R a difficult language to learn? 

  As I stated earlier, I find R to be pretty straightforward if you know another coding language. I had already learned SAS by the time I started learning R so I cannot speak to the difficulty level of learning it when starting from scratch. R has a lot of "cheat sheets" that are incredibly helpful for anyone already using R or just starting their learning experience with R.
